We will begin with Japanese mythology focusing on the stories of the creator goddess and Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line was descended. We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing.  From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan.  We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style.

Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel.  Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.</p><p/><p/><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:bold">DEC:     </span>J<br/><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:bold">SBC:     </span><a title="Pursue Deeper Understanding in the Humanities and Fine Arts">HFA+</a><p>3 credits</p><div class="clear">​</div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="course" id="334"><h3>AAS 334: English in Asia</h3><p>Study of the expanding roles of English in South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.  With more non-native speakers than native speakers, and more in Asia than elsewhere, English has acquired new identities.  We will study functions of English in colonial and post-colonial times; how it competes with, and complements local languages in business, advertising, media, education, research, administration, judiciary, creative literature, call centers, and on the Internet;  the evolution of dynamic  new Asian Englishes, such as Indian English, and their social and cultural contexts;  controversies regarding English medium education and its impact on local languages, relevance of native English standards, and implications for theory, description, and method in diverse disciplines, such as, business communication, cultural studies, English, lexicography, speech recognition, journalism, media studies, sociolinguistics, teaching English as a second language, and Asian Studies.</p><p>

  <h3>ANP 315: Climate Change and Human Evolution</h3>
  <p>Earth's climate has always been in a state of flux. Since human ancestors emerged on the landscape approximately 7 million years ago, the planet has faced drastic swings between moist and dry periods, as well as glacial freezes and thaws. It is clear that at least some of our ancestors were able to adapt and survive these climate shifts. Was the changing environment also responsible for shaping the evolutionary innovations that have come to define our species? This course will explore the relationship between climate, environment, and human evolution.</p>

Bigfoot, Atlantis, and ancient astronauts remain common subjects in mainstream media, but what do we, and what can we, really know about such subjects? In this course we will assemble a basic toolkit for skeptical inquiry, and apply it to several examples of anthropological pseudoscience. Dissecting these cases leads to an investigation of how we can distinguish truth from falsehood, and knowable facts from unknowable conjectures. Lastly, we will try to understand the persistence of pseudoscience and other forms of nonsense in our culture, as these clearly thrive despite their lack of grounding in reality.</p><p>

Stone tools and other technologies enabled early hominins to become the first organisms that could purposefully change their environment to suit their needs. This course traces the development of human technology where it first appears, in Eastern Africa, more than 3 million years ago.  Course topics include the cognitive abilities of early humans implied by their technologies, early human adaptation and social behavior, and the inter-relationships between stone tool technology, paleoecology, and hominin biological evolution. Lectures and practical exercises teach students how to document the archaeological record and how to use it to test hypotheses about early human behavior. Field excursions teach archaeological survey and excavation techniques.  Students conduct research and report their findings in writing and in oral presentations. Evaluation is based on quizzes, a final exam, group projects, a research paper, and participation.

  <h3>ANT 399: Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin</h3>
  <p>Intended to follow the Turkana Basin Institute (TBI) Field School in NW Kenya. It should facilitate TBI field school alumni participation in ongoing field projects directed by senior researchers within the Turkana Basin. Upper-division Stony Brook undergraduates who demonstrate readiness may undertake a junior role within a larger project focusing on archaeology or human ecology (<a href="/bulletin/current/courses/ant/#399" title="Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin">ANT 399</a>) or paleoanthropology or vertebrate paleontology (<a href="/bulletin/current/courses/anp/#399" title="Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin">ANP 399</a>). The nature of ANT/<a href="/bulletin/current/courses/anp/#399" title="Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin">ANP 399</a> offerings each semester will depend on which senior scholars are conducting field research and whether their projects are suitable for undergraduate involvement. They may include the opportunity to join a paleoanthropological survey of ancient landscapes for vertebrate remains (<a href="/bulletin/current/courses/anp/#399" title="Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin">ANP 399</a>), or to join an archaeological excavation of a 4000-year-old habitation site (<a href="/bulletin/current/courses/ant/#399" title="Advanced Field Research in the Turkana Basin">ANT 399</a>). Credit for each offering is determined for by the TBI faculty and is consistent for all registrants.</p>

  <h3>ANT 410: Ethnobotany and Paleoethnobotany</h3>
  <p>Explores relations between plants and people, both in present (ethnobotany) and prehistoric (paleoethnobotany, archaeobotany) times. Because ethnobotany and paleoethnobotany are interdisciplinary fields, we will draw on several contributing fields of study, including botany, cultural anthropology, archaeology, conservation. Students will be trained in botanical and social data collection methods in ethnobotanical research and will focus on paleoethnobotanical data collection/analysis: archaeobotanical recovery methods, and principles of curation, identification, and interpretation. Knowledge of ethnobotanical/ paleoethnobotanical methods will allow students to evaluate major works during the final weeks of the course.</p>

  <h3>ARH 339: The Art and Science of Astronomy</h3>
  <p>This interdisciplinary course examines how art and science relate in efforts to understand and visualize the cosmos. It traces how discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics have correlated with specific visual technologies and visual techniques, ranging from telescope observations through astrophotography to computational simulations. It explores how aesthetic strategies structure scientific practices of observation and representation, as well as how artists draw on scientific methods and images for creative experimentation. It asks how the mutual influence between science and art shapes the norms and assumptions of both, changing how we image and imagine what exists beyond the limits of ordinary perception.</p>

  <h3>ATM 397: Air Pollution and Global Warming</h3>
  <p>This course provides a detailed introduction of the formation of gaseous and particulate pollutants and the role they play in affecting global warming. The pollutants discussed include carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, ozone, hydrocarbons, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases. The emissions of these gases from natural and industrial sources and the principles used for controlling the latter are described. The chemical and physical transformations of the pollutants in the atmosphere are investigated and the phenomena of urban smog and acid rain are discussed. The impact of these pollutants on the planetÂ¿s climate are outlined. Current proposals of renewable energy supply and combatting temperature increase by geoengineering solutions are examined. This course discusses technical, ethical, and commercial perspectives that have shaped pollution producing industrial processes during historical times and in the present era. The efforts to formulate regulatory control mechanisms to limit the impact of air pollution and to ameliorate global warming are outlined in this class.</p>

  <h3>BIO 332: Computational Modeling of Physiological Systems</h3>
  <p>Introduces students to the fundamental principles underlying computational modeling of complex physiological systems. A major focus of the course will be on the process by which a model of a biological system is developed. Students will be introduced to the mathematical methods required for the modeling of complex systems (including stochastic processes and both temporal and spatial dynamics) as well as to tools for computational simulation. Roughly one half of the class will focus on models for general cellular physiology, while the remaining half will focus on the development of higher-level models of a particular physiological system (for example, the neurobiological systems underlying learning). This course is offered as both <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/ams/#332" title="Computational Modeling of Physiological Systems">AMS 332</a> and <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/bio/#332" title="Computational Modeling of Physiological Systems">BIO 332</a> and is intended for STEM majors who have already completed the foundational courses in their major. Students who satisfy the pre-requisites but do not have a deeper background in some STEM field may find the class very challenging and should ask the instructor for guidance before registering.</p>

  <h3>CDS 101: Energy, Climate, and Society</h3>
  <p>The energy consumption of 21st century societies is causing the Earth's climate to warm at an alarming rate, threatening terrestrial life as we know it; this impasse scientists sometimes call a "wicked problem." What is the history of energy consumption that has brought us to this point? How did we become aware - culturally and scientifically - of the crisis? What are the cascading impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services?  How can we imagine moving through the impasse and emerging on the other side? What are the political opportunities and blockages? How can we change our societies to be less energy intensive and more adaptable to the warming already baked into the climate system? What kinds of engineered solutions - carbon sequestering and clean energy, for example - are here or on the horizon? This class will explore these issues from several transdisciplinary perspectives, from climate science to chemistry to urban planning to literature and film.</p>

  <h3>COM 405: Political Communication</h3>
  <p>An exploration of the interdisciplinary field of political communication, looking at how media, political elites, and citizens interact. The course approaches political communication from both normative and empirical perspectives. The course begins with discussions on normative models for how political communication should contribute to democratic citizenship and governance. Students will then examine the deviations, limitations, and distractions of those normative ideals in practice across different contexts. The roles of various forms of communication will be examined in the US and international political processes. Course content explores macro perspectives on culture, ideology, and political economy; organizational models of news production and deliberation; and micro approaches in the political psychology of media use and cognition.</p>

Unit 1 (Ultimate Aspects of Sex) will review hypotheses related to recombination and anisogamy (different sized gametes), continuing on to sexual selection theory, which is the theoretical backbone for understanding sex differences in morphology and behavior. In Unit 2 (Proximate Aspects of Sex), we take a step back and discuss the genetic and hormonal mechanisms governing sex-typical development. Here we will also address alternative pathways of sexual differentiation, the physiological underpinnings of sexual motivation and sexual response, and puberty. Finally, in Unit 3 (Human Sexuality), we will take these two approaches and apply them to questions of human sexuality, addressing controversial topics such as mate choice, sexuality, sexual coercion, as well as more curious topics such as the evolution of the female orgasm and external testes.</p><p>

  <h3>EBH 331: Hormones and Behavior</h3>
  <p>Examines the relationship between hormones and behavior, both in terms of how hormones affect behavior, and how behavioral interactions can alter hormones. Because hormonal structure and function is remarkably conserved across vertebrates, we will take a comparative approach, exploring data from a variety of vertebrate model systems, while maintaining a keen eye on how such models inform of us about hormones and behavior in humans and non-human primates. Topics to be explored include sex determination, reproductive behavior, personality, dominance and aggression, biological rhythms, the stress response, and the role of endocrine disrupting chemicals in behavior.

  <h3>EBH 405: Life History and Development</h3>
  <p>Uses life history theory as a framework for exploring the biological processes of the primate and human life cycle (development, reproduction, senescence). We will first construct a solid foundation of life history theory and the principle of energetic tradeoffs. We will then use this foundation to address why species and individuals vary in the pattern and tempo of development, reproduction, and senescence. In the process, we will address questions such as: Why do humans invest so much in offspring and what factors influence individual differences in parental investment? What is the function of menopause? What is the purpose of a prolonged juvenile period (i.e., childhood)? And when and why should the pace of development accelerate or slow down? We will examine these questions from a comparative perspective, drawing not just on studies focusing on humans, but also on those focusing on nonhuman primates and other mammals.</p>

  <p>This course is an introduction to how economists, in particular macroeconomists, think about the world. It is required for students that will major in economics and recommended along with <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/eco/#110" title="Introduction to Microeconomics">ECO 110</a> to those who want an overview of economics. Any other course you take in economics will build in part upon the knowledge and skills you develop in ECO111, along with <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/eco/#110" title="Introduction to Microeconomics">ECO 110</a>. Hence, some fundamental concepts will be covered with some degree of complexity, even though this is an introductory course.</p>

  <h3>EGL 140: Shakespeare in Performance</h3>
  <p>An introduction to Shakespeare in performance. This course will focus on key scenes and soliloquies so students can take time with the language and theatrical tools of Shakespeare's work. We will watch these scenes performed in many different ways to think about how the language is brought to life in different times and contexts by and for different people. Students will create a performance as a way to think about the plays. We will discuss the plays as engaged works of art, not historical artifacts, and tools with which we learn to see more, see differently, see better.</p>

A Humanities Approach</h3><p>The idea of 'public health' could be described as an endeavor of figuring out how to promote health protective measures across populations of disparate individuals who nevertheless depend on one another in important ways. At the same time, we are a society which prizes personal responsibility and seeks out individual attention and expression. How do we keep a population safe and healthy while respecting our highly individualized national character? This course examines this tension through reference to novels, narrative accounts, drama, and essays where you will have an opportunity to think through these seminal 'threshold' questions on your own. This course is offered as both <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/egl/#290" title="What is Public Health? A Humanities Approach">EGL 290</a> and HPH 201.</p><p>

As we discuss the metaphors or tropes of empire, we will also examine the concept of empire as a historical and contemporary formation, or what an empire meant in the 19th century and what it means today in the early 21st century. The course begins with the premise that travel narratives and modern visual culture illuminate the relationship between the violence and romance of travel. The course includes modern travel narratives (i.e. novels by Asian Americans) that focus on the lives of those who are forced to travel or migrate due to civil war, poverty and/or economic instability.

  <h3>EGL 381: Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing</h3>
  <p>Argumentative writing involves making a claim and supporting it with specific, related points and appropriate evidence--in other words, it is thesis-driven writing. Whenever we don't quite like someone else's idea and we want him or her to come closer to ours, argumentative writing is the most efficient method for such persuasion, in whatever profession you're considering. This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies.  Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.  This course will fulfill the second half of the Writing Pre-Med/Pre-Health prerequisite. Covers the
Interdisciplinary topic for the English major. This course is offered as both <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/egl/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">EGL 381</a> and <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/wrt/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">WRT 381</a>.</p>

  <h3>FLA 307: Critical Pedagogy</h3>
  <p>An introduction to the theories and practices of critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy assembles numerous forms of academic approaches to teaching and curriculum that are informed by critical social theory. As the educational arm of critical social theory, critical pedagogy engages educators in understanding the relationships among knowledge, ideology, and power. We will read works from several critical pedagogy theorists to explore and analyze some of the key themes within critical pedagogy (education &amp; power; difference &amp; pluralism; transformative education; the social construction of knowledge; dialogic relations in the classroom; teaching for social justice). Learning through collaborative inquiry, we will translate the theories in these readings into practice and will test concepts of teaching and learning "critical (second/foreign) language and literacy" in a school setting.</p>

  <h3>GEO 104: Ripples Across the World: Global Effects of Natural Disasters</h3>
  <p>Earthquakes and tsunamis create widespread devastation. Volcanic eruptions bury cities under ash and cause closures of distant airports. Heavy rains cause landslides and flooding. How do these disasters happen? What are the secondary global effects on societal infrastructure, on public health, on international trade? How do societal differences cause varied local responses and affect the global impact? This course focuses on evaluating the global effects of several recent geological disasters. Scientific and popular news sources are used to explore the underlying natural phenomena and the nature and global distribution of the effects from geologic, economic, and public health perspectives.</p>

Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.</p><p/><p/><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:bold">SBC:     </span><a title="Evaluate and Synthesize Researched Information">ESI</a>, <a title="Speak Effectively before an Audience">SPK</a>, <a title="Understand Relationships between Science or Technology and the Arts, Humanities, or Social Sciences">STAS</a><p>3 credits</p><div class="clear">​</div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="course" id="241"><h3>HIS 241: Nazi Genocide and the Holocaust</h3><p>The rise of modern anti-Semitism since the late 18th century and its political application in Nazi Germany.

What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors?  Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean worldÂ¿Latin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic worldÂ¿between roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.</p><p>

difference as the basis of national greatness, superiority and global social hierarchy. At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less
than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society). Finally, the course also teaches historians how to use literary fiction as historical sources (a methodology distinct from but linked to that of literature departments), in conjunction with primary and secondary historical works.</p><p>

In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world's premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution -- a 'socialist' revolution--that sought to give its citizens economic and social security 'from the cradle to the grave.' At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and
decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that
continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of
empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be
explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.</p><p>

How do we make sense of the 1960s as a transnational, global set of experiences whose revolutionary heroes from Che Guevara to The Beatles and imagery were deeply intertwined?

  <h3>ISE 337: Scripting Languages</h3>
  <p>Scripting languages are widely used in the IT industry. Programming with scripting languages, also known as scripting, has several advantages compared to programming with other types of languages in that scripts facilitate rapid program development; can automate high-level jobs or tasks very effectively; and can be used to compose various software components, even binaries, into more complex and powerful applications. This course introduces the principles of scripting, covers one or two selected scripting languages in depth, and illustrates the advanced use of scripting by extensive case studies in application areas such as system administration, web application development, graphical user interface development, and text processing.</p>

  <h3>JRN 319: The Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture</h3>
  <p>Students will analyze the impact of conflicting images of journalists in movies and television on the American public's perception of journalists in the 20th and 21st centuries. The public adopts perceptions of journalists based on portrayals in the media, often without considering the accuracy and/or dramatization of these representations. Few people will ever witness a journalist in action. Yet many have very specific ideas of what journalists do because they have read about journalists in novels, short stories and comic books, and they have seen them in movies, television, plays, and cartoons. This class explores how these representations in the media contribute to public perceptions about journalists, and explores the trajectory of these perceptions from the days of silent films through the 21st century.</p>

  <h3>JRN 413: Journalisms of the Global South</h3>
  <p>A historical and socio-communicational exploration of the genres and styles of journalism emerging and shaping the different regions of the Global South since the early mercantile expansion of the 17th century and into the 21st century. In parallel with the colonial push into the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, journalistic narratives start to shape the Western view of the new worlds. But the process has a dual nature: these styles and genres are appropriated, re-signified and repurposed locally, giving birth to an array of journalisms that do not conform with their Western counterparts. CrÃ³nicas, corridos, roman feuilleton, and a vast number of other forms of journalisms born in the Global South are discussed during this course. The class aims at expanding the Western idea of journalism as the watchdog of democracy, and to understanding journalism in the Global South in its historical context, within its political, pedagogical and literary roles.</p>

  <h3>LIN 280: Language in Social Media</h3>
  <p>Social media came into being along with the internet in the 1990s, and have rapidly become an ubiquitous form of communication and information.  This course provides an exploration of how language is used in social media, and how language in social media can be analyzed.  We start out by understanding how humans form social networks and what the properties of these networks are.  We then compare how the emergence of social media has changed the manner in which we humans communicate, and investigate possible positive and negative effects of this change.  One of the major effects is that many more people are 'publishing' today, and we will discover how this has affected public language use.  We also discuss the technology behind social media, and learn about the dangers in social media.  We also discuss the technologies used in social media, and learn about the potential and the dangers that lie in these technologies.</p>

  <h3>MAR 373: Marine Apex Predators: Ecology and Conservation</h3>
  <p>The removal of apex predators is one of the most pervasive impacts of humans on Earth's ecosystems. In the past few decades we have started to recognize how the loss of these species has caused substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystem diversity and function, mediated by changes in prey population dynamics and behavior. It is only recently that we have realized that changes in the abundance of apex predators in the ocean (e.g., sharks, marine mammals, tuna and other large predatory bony fish) may be causing similar changes in coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems. In this course we will (1) review the biology of key marine apex predators, (2) explore how 'top down' processes (predation and intimidation of prey) can influence marine ecosystems and (3) review the status of marine apex predators and how this relates to the current state of ocean ecosystems. We will draw from the primary literature, from both the terrestrial and marine realms, and host outside speakers who study these animals in the field.</p>

  <h3>MAT 444: Experiential Learning</h3>
  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>

However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. We examine human political behavior from evolutionary, genetic, and neurobiological perspectives, considering literature on non-human animals, developmental psychology, personality, psychophysiology, neurobiology, genetics, hormones, disgust sensitivity, and mating.</p><p>

  <h3>SOC 444: Experiential Learning</h3>
  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>

Students will explore how and why disasters are fundamentally social events: What do disasters reveal about society? Why are the human consequences of disasters unequally distributed? What are the typical ways in which states, organizations, and communities respond to disasters? Focusing on case studies from around the world, students will discuss: What are the long-term/short-term causes of particular disasters? What forms of suffering the disasters under consideration generated? What state/civil society actions did they trigger? What advocacy networks were put in place in their aftermath?

  <h3>SUS 362: Resilient Communities</h3>
  <p>Resilience as a process can be embodied by communities who proactively prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to actual or potential future adverse events, instead of bearing repeated damage and continuously demand for federal disaster assistance. This course explores the idea of resilience as an outcome and as a process from different perspectives and in different contexts. We will first study resilience through the lens of  sociopolitical ecology of risk and vulnerability. Then we will explore resilience in the face of natural, social and economic instabilities or shocks. Finally we will discuss long term risk management, governance models, policies and politics involved in making our communities more resilient.</p>

It examines the ways in which the dynamics of human-environment relationship have shaped the development of African societies and economies from the rise of ancient civilizations to the contemporary problems of war and famine. Although significant attention will be given to the pre-colonial era (like the impacts of iron-working, irrigation, deforestation and desertification), the focus of the course will be on the 20th and century and after, looking at the impacts of imperialism, colonialism, globalization and the postcolonial quest for development on the state of the environment in Africa. In the discussion, we will demonstrate that the shaping of African environments and ecologies is a product of complex, evolving and interconnected developments between humans and nature within and beyond the African continent.

  <h3>SUS 406: Coastal Housing Resilience</h3>
  <p>This course addresses the inequalities of coastal housing vulnerability. With the increasing frequency of coastal hazards, affordable housing is disproportionately damaged, while the tourism industry loses revenue. These perilous dynamics are widening disparities in availability and vulnerability of housing types that serve two different groups: low-moderate income permanent residents and seasonal residents and tourists. Through case studies and community-engaged learning, this course will engage students in learning the processes and mechanisms that shape the inequalities in vulnerability, recovery and resilience of housing in coastal communities.</p>

We will consider language broadly by looking at and experimenting with a range of communicative forms recruited to address social justice.

  <h3>WRT 376: Digital Rhetorics</h3>
  <p>In antiquity, rhetoric was an art of persuasion carried out through the medium of voice. Since the printing press, rhetoric and composition have been concerned with rhetoric in written word. Today, in the 21st century, we face digitality, defying any attempt to easily delineate speech, writing, and visuality. What does it mean to compose, interpret, and argue through digitality? What does it mean to practice rhetoric as a civic art when our communities are global and hyperconnected? This course explores the subfield of digital rhetoric, which aims to capture answers to these questions and more.</p>

  <h3>WRT 380: Advanced Research Writing: Theories, Methods, Practices</h3>
  <p>Good research skills are critical to academic success.  Most disciplines require writing based upon research, as arguments and explanations make little impact on audiences without effective supporting evidence, drawn from relevant scholarship on the subject. This involves knowing how to use appropriate databases, source materials, and composing processes, as well as negotiating the values, genres, and languages of the scholarly communities in which one is researching.  In this course, students will learn fundamentals of research methods, practice these methods in a series of integrated research and writing assignments, and engage in critical reflection about research and writing.  Students will focus on an area of disciplinary interest to them, and practice these essential research and writing skills through a series of projects: library assignments, research log, research proposal, annotated bibliography, literature review, abstract, research paper and reflection paper.</p>

  <h3>WRT 381: Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing</h3>
  <p>Argumentative writing involves making a claim and supporting it with specific, related points and appropriate evidence--in other words, it is thesis-driven writing. Whenever we don't quite like someone else's idea and we want him or her to come closer to ours, argumentative writing is the most efficient method for such persuasion, in whatever profession you're considering. This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies.  Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.  This course will fulfill the second half of the Writing Pre-Med/Pre-Health prerequisite. Covers the
Interdisciplinary topic for the English major. This course is offered as both <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/egl/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">EGL 381</a> and <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/wrt/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">WRT 381</a>.</p>

  <h3>WRT 382: Grant Writing</h3>
  <p>Introduces students to the fundamentals of seeking and writing scholarly grants to fund research-based projects, from the earliest stages of planning to the completion of the grant application. In consultation with the instructor, each student works for the entire semester on applying for a real grant that is external to Stony Brook University. Key subjects to be taught include understanding funders and funding opportunities, researching and locating one's position in the disciplinary field of the grant, articulating relevant problems in that field, specifying appropriate and evidence-based solutions, addressing specific audiences, and utilizing rhetorical appeals. In addition to frequent low-stakes writing tasks, the course requires three high-stakes written projects: a literature review, a research proposal, and a grant application along with an abstract.</p>

  <h3>WRT 392: Theories and Methods of Mentoring Writers</h3>
  <p>Closely examines the difficulties implicit in mentoring writers, with special consideration for the roles of cultural expectations and social dynamics on both the teaching of writing and writers themselves. In small groups and one-to-one interactions, students explore theories and practices upon which composition instruction and writing center work depend. Building on the understanding that writing is a recursive process (a cycle of planning, drafting, revising, and editing), students also learn to analyze and problem-solve issues that become barriers for effective writing and communication.</p>

  <h3>WRT 444: Experiential Learning</h3>
  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>
